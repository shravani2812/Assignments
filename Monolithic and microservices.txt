MONOLITHIC AND MICROSERVICE ARCHITECTURE
A monolithic application is built as a single unified unit while a microservice architecture is a collection of smaller, independently deployable services
NEFLIX was the pioneer in microservice architecture. Apparently, in 2009 Netflix was the first company to shift from monolithic to microservices
ADVANTAGES OF MONOLITHIC:
->Easy deployment
->Development
->Performance
->Simplified Testing
->Easy debugging
DISADV OF MONOLITHIC
->Slower deployement
->Scalability
->Reliability
->Lack of flexibility
ADV OF MICROSERVICES
->Agility
->Flexible Scaling
->Continous deployment
->High Reliability
->Highly maintainable and testable
DISADV OF MICROSERVICES
->Exponential infrastructure
->Added organizational overhead
->Lack of standardization
->Lack of clear ownership
